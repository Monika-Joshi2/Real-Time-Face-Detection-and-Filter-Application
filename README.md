# Real-Time Face Detection and Filter Application System  

This project demonstrates a system for real-time face detection and dynamic filter application, including blurring, magic eraser effects, and Snapchat-style filters. It showcases the potential for interactive applications in entertainment and augmented reality.  

## **Features**  
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Accurately detects faces in live video streams.  
- **Dynamic Filters**: Applies blurring, magic eraser, and Snapchat-style filters seamlessly.  
- **Facial Feature Tracking**: Ensures precise filter placement and adaptability to movements.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing.  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  

## **How It Works**  
1. Captures real-time video feed from the camera.  
2. Detects facial features and tracks movements.  
3. Overlays selected filters dynamically in real-time.
